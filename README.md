# MM209Assignment

For running the code,the user needs to run the iPython notebook by selecting Run all cells option.A prompt will ask the user to enter the temperature value.After the execution the last 7 code cells give the complete set of outputs.df1 and df2 are the dataframes which contain all the data about the first and second group of metals.These dataframes are joined to form a third dataframe df3 which contains the complete data of all metals.Bar graphs showing pH20/pH2 and ln(pH20/pH2) of each metal are drawn to also visualise the obtained values.A line graph of ln(pH20/pH2) is also drawn.

In addition the user can also add metals of their own choice to the data frame uncommenting the code provided in the 4th cell and adding the required values.The code is reusable and should work for other metals as well.
